# Python Music Visualizer

This includes a frame_creator.py file and a python notebook to create the video.

Place the required audio.wav file along with frame_creator.py in the same folder. The code will generate an 'images' folder with all the frames present in it. Use the python notebook to create a video using the frames and the audio input.
